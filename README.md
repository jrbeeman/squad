A fork of Squad message style by Kyle Haskins:
http://www.adiumxtras.com/index.php?a=xtras&xtra_id=7679

I couldn't find the original source for this style hosted anywhere, so I'm
unsure about licensing for it.

Changes over the original style:

* Attemped to cleanup markup a bit
* Even simpler message styles, especially in IRC or group Jabber chat

Installation
============

1. Clone this repository
2. Rename it to ``Squad.AdiumMessageStyle``
3. Install the style using one of two options:

  * Move the folder to ~/Library/Application Support/Adium 2.0/Message Styles/
  * Double-click the folder in Finder, which will launch the Adium plug-in installer.
